- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

According to the above summary output we recieved we can see that the vehicle length and the vehicle ground clearance are most likely to give us non-random amounts of variance. The vehicle length and clearances will take a toll on the MPG of the vehicle.

- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

The linear model is NOT considered zero! Our P-VALURE IS 5.35e-11 which we can see is smaller than the significance of 0.05%.

- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

We can somewhat say that yess, this linear regression model deos predict mpg for the MechaCar prototyles effectively because when we look at our R squared value it shows us to be .7149 which is considered 71%. That 71% is used for the mpg predictions.
